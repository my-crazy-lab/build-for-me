# Reviewly - Self Review for Performance Review

## Problem

- Many employees don‚Äôt know how to self-evaluate properly: reluctant to write, afraid to sound boastful, or unsure which data to select as evidence.
- HR spends excessive time reading and consolidating self-reviews that vary greatly in format, quality, and completeness.
- Managers struggle to benchmark salaries effectively against market standards due to lack of standardized data and clear, concise summaries.

## Notes for Code Generation

- ‚úÖ Optimize SEO  
  - Use semantic HTML5 structure  
  - Set correct `<title>`, `meta description`, and Open Graph tags  
  - All images must include `alt` attributes  
  - Generate and link to `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`  
  - Use clean, readable URLs (no `?id=123`)  
  - Ensure responsive design and fast loading speed (Core Web Vitals)  
  - Apply structured data (Schema.org) where applicable  
  - Avoid duplicate content and broken links  

- üîê Advance Security  
  - Enforce HTTPS and use secure SSL/TLS settings  
  - Set security headers: `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, etc.  
  - Validate and sanitize all inputs on both client and (eventual) backend  
  - Use proper file permission and avoid exposing sensitive `.env`/config files  
  - Prepare for CSRF/XSS protection in future backend integration  
  - Include `TODO security` notes at sensitive logic areas for later audit  
  - Implement basic rate limiting or CAPTCHA where forms exist (even mock ones)  

- Separate interfaces and enums into two distinct TypeScript files.  
  - Always use `import type` when importing interfaces.  
  - When importing, keep enums and interfaces in separate import blocks for clarity.

- Include clear and thorough code comments, plus a standard header comment at the top of every file covering purpose, details, creation date, and version.  
- Focus heavily on delivering a visually stunning UI with smooth animations and excellent UX.  
- No backend implementation required initially; use mocked/fake data on the client side with clear `TODO backend` comments for future integration.  
- Deployment is out of scope.
