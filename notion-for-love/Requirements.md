## üîß Additional Technical Details & Project Management

### 1. Detailed Data Model Enhancements

- **Emotion types:**  
  Define a set of common emotions (e.g., happy, sad, excited, frustrated, loved, anxious) to standardize emotion tagging.  
  Allow adding custom emotions if needed.

- **Tags:**  
  Standardize tag lists per module (milestones, goals, tasks, memories, etc.) for consistent categorization, e.g., Travel, Finance, Romantic, Family, Health, Learning.  
  Support nested tags if required.

- **Media storage:**  
  Clarify backend media storage (photos, videos, voice clips):  
  - Use cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase Storage, etc.)  
  - Store media URLs in the database  
  - Define max file size and allowed formats.

---

### 2. Preliminary API Specification (per module)

- CRUD endpoints for all entities (milestones, goals, tasks, memories, emotions, capsules, events, vault, growth tracker)  
- Pagination, filtering, sorting for list APIs  
- Global search API and module-specific search (with advanced filters)  
- Media upload API supporting multipart/form-data or pre-signed URLs

---

### 3. Performance & Caching

- MongoDB indexes on frequently searched fields:  
  - relationshipId, userId, date, status, tags  
- Cache popular search results using Redis or similar  
- Use pagination or infinite scroll on APIs returning large lists  
- Optimize backend queries to avoid full collection scans

## Notes for Code Generation

- ‚úÖ Optimize SEO  
  - Use semantic HTML5 structure  
  - Set correct `<title>`, `meta description`, and Open Graph tags  
  - All images must include `alt` attributes  
  - Generate and link to `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`  
  - Use clean, readable URLs (no `?id=123`)  
  - Ensure responsive design and fast loading speed (Core Web Vitals)  
  - Apply structured data (Schema.org) where applicable  
  - Avoid duplicate content and broken links  

- üîê Advance Security  
  - Enforce HTTPS and use secure SSL/TLS settings  
  - Set security headers: `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, etc.  
  - Validate and sanitize all inputs on both client and (eventual) backend  
  - Use proper file permission and avoid exposing sensitive `.env`/config files  
  - Prepare for CSRF/XSS protection in future backend integration  
  - Include `TODO security` notes at sensitive logic areas for later audit  
  - Implement basic rate limiting or CAPTCHA where forms exist (even mock ones)  

- Include clear and thorough code comments, plus a standard header comment at the top of every file covering purpose, details, creation date, and version.  
- Focus heavily on delivering a visually stunning UI with smooth animations and excellent UX.  
- Deployment is out of scope.
